// 12) Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names: string[] = ["Aasia", "Gul", "Sadia", "Shumaila", "Nuzhat"];

console.log(`Make sure to subscribe my channel, ${names[0]}`);
console.log(`Make sure to subscribe my channel, ${names[1]}`);
console.log(`Make sure to subscribe my channel, ${names[2]}`);
console.log(`Make sure to subscribe my channel, ${names[3]}`);
console.log(`Make sure to subscribe my channel, ${names[4]}`);
